Data Flow Breakdown:
User Flow:

A User signs up and logs in.
If the user is a Seller, they can create Products.
If the user is a Buyer, they can browse products, add them to the Cart, and place Orders.
Cart & Checkout Flow:

The Buyer adds Products to the Cart (which has multiple CartItems).
The user proceeds to checkout, and a new Order is created.
Each CartItem is converted into an OrderItem, and the cart is cleared.
Order Processing:

The Order status updates as the purchase progresses (e.g., Pending → Shipped → Delivered).
Sellers can view orders related to their products.
